# PAS Types: Torque Sensing vs Cadence Sensing

Most ebikes come with a pedal assist system (PAS) that activates the motor as the rider pedals the bike. There are two primary types of PAS, both of which have pros and cons. Neither can be said to be "better" in a broad sense. The PAS you choose will depend on what you want from an ebike as well as your budget.

## Cadence Sensing PAS

Cadence sensing PAS works by engaging the motor at a fixed power level when the pedals are rotating. A rotation sensor is placed at the pedal crank. The rider sets the motor power level using a switch located on the handlebars, and the PAS engages the motor at the desired power level when the pedals are rotating.

A key aspect of cadence sensing PAS is that the rotation sensor has no ability to detect he amount of force being applied to the pedals. The motor engages at whatever level is configured by the rider, regardless of how hard or soft the rider pedals. On most ebikes with cadence sensing PAS, the PAS levels correspond to a given speed. For example, PAS 1 might correspond to 8 mph. PAS 2 to 12 mph, PAS 2 to 18 mph, PAS 3 to 20 mph, PAS 4 to 24 mph, and PAS 5 to 28 mph. If you leave the bike in PAS 3, it will accelerate to 20 mph once you start pedaling, even if you only pedal lightly.

Commuters frequently prefer this type of PAS because it is not dependent on rider effort. You can relax and pedal lightly while controlling your speed using the PAS level selector. It's a bit like cruise control in a car. However, the PAS does not adjust for inclines. If you go up a hill, the bike will slow down if left in the same PAS level.

## Torque Sensing PAS

Torque sensing PAS works by engaging the motor at a power level that is proportional to rider input. A torque sensor is placed at the pedal crank. The rider sets the proportion of motor power using a switch located on the handlebars, and the PAS automatically adjusts the motor power to match this proportion.

With this type of PAS, pedaling harder will cause the motor to increase in power to match your effort. For this reason, most riders report that torque sensing PAS has a more "natural" cycling feel. It still feels like you're the one pedaling the bike, but you feel much stronger than you actually are. The PAS levels with this type of PAS correspond to the ratio of effort matching by the electric motor. For example, PAS 1 might correspond to 40% matched effort, PAS 2 to 100% match, PAS 3 to 150% match, and PAS 4 to 200% match. Some ebikes can go up to 250% effort matching.

MTB riders and riders coming from a traditional cycling background frequently prefer this type of PAS because it has a more natural feel, and gives the rider tighter control over their speed. If you want to go faster, you simply pedal a little bit harder, just like you would on a regular bicycle. If you want to go faster without working as hard, you simply increase the PAS level. However, some level of effort is always required, since the motor is only matching your effort.
